# elm-restful

This package contains functions useful for working a RESTful backend (particularly
as implemented in Drupal) for an Elm application.

It is a companion to [drupal-elm-starter](https://github.com/Gizra/drupal-elm-starter).
`drupal-elm-starter` represents an entire (but simple) sample app, whereas this contains
pieces of code as a package that can be used in multiple projects.
